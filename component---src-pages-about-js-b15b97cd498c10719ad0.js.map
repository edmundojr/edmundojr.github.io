I\n        guess my journey is similar to others, Iâ€™ve started my career as a finished artist â€“ which entails checking\n        for mistakes and configuring artwork for print production, and after a little while I moved to graphic\n        design, designing pretty much everything that could be printed on paper â€“ book design, brand design,\n        business cards, the lot! I work as a graphic designer for about 5 years or so.\n      </p>{' '}\n      <p>\n        On that same job I had the opportunity to design and develop the companyâ€™s website (mostly because the\n        company didnâ€™t have anyone else to do it), and I immediatilly fell in love with UI design, both the design\n        and implementation aspects of it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        From that point onward, I change my focus to UI design and development. It was not a big change really, as\n        most of the skills were still valid and transferable from my previous life as a graphic designer. What was\n        really new and exciting was getting to implement and code the UIs I would come up with, playing with\n        different transitions and animationsâ€¦ basically lots of fun!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For the next 5 years I worked mostly doing web design and front-end development, and with every website I\n        did I would focus more and more on the user experience side of things, which finally brought me to UI/UX\n        design.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Today I considered myself a product designer, and my routine consists of researching, designing,\n        prototyping, coding, user testingâ€¦ all of the UI/UX keywords really!\n      </p>\n      <p>If you made this far, thanks! I hope you find a better use of your time in the future! ðŸ˜…</p>\n    </main>*/}\n  </Layout>\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}

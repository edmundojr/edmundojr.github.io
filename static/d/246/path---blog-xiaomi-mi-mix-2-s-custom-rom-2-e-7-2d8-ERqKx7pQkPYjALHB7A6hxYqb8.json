I had my eyes on two phones: the Pixel 3 and the OnePlus 6T. I was sorely disappointed by the Pixel's notch (and the price), and absolutely loved the OnePlus 6T, but the price was a bit for me. So I ended up buying a Xiaomi.</p>\n<p>Now… I'm a big fan of pure, clean Android ROMs, like the Oxygen OS or the Pixel ones, and even though MIUI 10 was not as bad as I expected, the amount of crap Xiaomi puts into the phone is crazy, so I deviced to install a custom ROM. Here's the steps for installing a custom ROM on the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Enable <strong>Developer Tools</strong> by going to <code class=\"language-text\">Settings › About Phone</code>, and tapping on <code class=\"language-text\">MIUI Version</code> for about 7-10 times. You should see a message saying “You are now a developer”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable <strong>OEM unlocking</strong> option by going to Settings › Additional Settings › Developer Tools`</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You need to <a href=\"https://global.account.xiaomi.com/pass/register\">create a Xiaomi account</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s/development/rom-pixel-experience-t3872863\">https://forum.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s/development/rom-pixel-experience-t3872863</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S: the Pixel without the notch","date":"07 Dec 2018","tags":["Android","Hacking"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s-custom-rom/"}}

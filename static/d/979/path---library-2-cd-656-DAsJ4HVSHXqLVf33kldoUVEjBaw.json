His accessible style and far-reaching interests in subjects ranging from science to humor to history earned him the nickname \"the Great Explainer.\" <i>I. Asimov</i> is his personal story—vivid, open, and honest—as only Asimov himself could tell it.<br /><br />Here is the story of the paradoxical genius who wrote of travel to the stars yet refused to fly in airplanes; who imagined alien universes and vast galactic civilizations while staying home to write; who compulsively authored more than 470 books yet still found the time to share his ideas with some of the great minds of our century. Here are his wide-ranging thoughts and sharp-eyed observations on everything from religion to politics, love and divorce, friendship and Hollywood, fame and mortality. Here, too, is a riveting behind-the-scenes look at the varied personalities—Campbell, Ellison, Heinlein, Clarke, del Rey, Silverberg, and others—who along with Asimov helped shape science fiction.<br /><br />As unique and irrepressible as the man himself, <i>I. Asimov</i> is the candid memoir of an incomparable talent who entertained readers for nearly half a century and whose work will surely endure into the future he so vividly envisioned.","published":"2009","authors":[{"id":"2e338a56-552b-5bfd-a8c3-8b25a25e963a"}]}},{"node":{"id":"3e762467-6643-57ca-bc2c-9c1e3ca9f4c1","title":"Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions,","title_without_series":"Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions,","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18881237-universal-principles-of-design-revised-and-updated","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_month":"","publication_year":null,"average_rating":"4.13","ratings_count":"4536","description":"","published":null,"authors":[{"id":"ca508a5b-13cd-5633-bc3b-2ab1739a388a"}]}},{"node":{"id":"5af9068f-0daa-54c3-9e26-7f4870c23d53","title":"Hugo Chávez, O Espectro","title_without_series":"Hugo Chávez, O Espectro","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39288369-hugo-ch-vez-o-espectro","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_month":"","publication_year":null,"average_rating":"4.67","ratings_count":"6","description":"","published":null,"authors":[{"id":"23d3cc57-613f-5930-8ba2-072a02620e45"}]}},{"node":{"id":"777a0e3a-a316-5e23-9baa-d7231feae3f7","title":"A Theory of Human Motivation","title_without_series":"A Theory of Human Motivation","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22245487-a-theory-of-human-motivation","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_month":"","publication_year":null,"average_rating":"4.20","ratings_count":"502","description":"Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper \"A Theory of Human Motivation\" in Psychological Review.

Here is a rich cornucopia of horror and ghosts stories, science fiction and fairy tales, fabulism and poetry that explore the realm of experience and emotion. In \"Adventure Story\"--a thematic companion to <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i>--Gaiman ponders death and the way people take their stories with them when they die. His social media experience \"A Calendar of Tales\" are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the year--stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a Mother's Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> in his award-nominated mystery tale \"The Case of Death and Honey\". And \"Click-Clack the Rattlebag\" explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we're all alone in the darkness.<br /><br />A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent. Full of wonder and terror, surprises and amusements, <i>Trigger Warning</i> is a treasury of delights that engage the mind, stir the heart, and shake the soul from one of the most unique and popular literary artists of our day.","published":"2015","authors":[{"id":"32df4a08-7ad4-5b6e-bd18-f25ceda36ab4"}]}},{"node":{"id":"620f9dc2-d761-552b-b06b-f5bcf700a073","title":"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay","title_without_series":"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1481542648m/29363501.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1481542648s/29363501.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29363501-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them","num_pages":"293","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Arthur A.

Órfão aos 10 anos, o menino é capturado pelos dinamarqueses, que lhe ensinam o modo de vida viking. Só que o destino de Uhtred está inevitavelmente ligado a Alfredo, rei de Wessex, governante do único reino inglês a não se dobrar perante a fúria dos guerreiros do norte.<br /><br />A luta ferrenha entre ingleses e dinamarqueses e o embate entre cristianismo e paganismo compõem o cenário desta obra-prima de Bernard Cornwell. Aos 11 anos, Uhtred está em dúvida quanto à sua lealdade, mas uma matança em um fria manhã de inverno o leva para o lado inglês, que a essa altura se encontra totalmente dominado pelos destemidos dinamarqueses.<br /><br />O último Reino é o primeiro volume da história de Alfredo, o Grande, e de seus descendentes. Em torno desse lendário personagem histórico, Bernard Cornwell tece uma belíssima história de lealdade dividida, amor relutante e heroísmo desesperado. Uhtred, sem dúvida, é um dos personagens mais interessantes da longa galeria de heróis do autor, e O Último Reino, um de seus romances mais poderosos e apaixonados.","published":"2012","authors":[{"id":"b06f2737-284b-51ed-a58e-aacae4fb56f8"}]}},{"node":{"id":"bc459dd0-e3a6-5019-b2b3-7c51921987f0","title":"Belas Maldições: As Belas e Precisas Profecias de Agnes Nutter, Bruxa","title_without_series":"Belas Maldições: As Belas e Precisas Profecias de Agnes Nutter, Bruxa","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1379721792m/11434768.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1379721792s/11434768.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11434768-belas-maldi-es","num_pages":"374","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Bertrand Brasil","publication_day":"15","publication_month":"12","publication_year":"1998","average_rating":"4.25","ratings_count":"380166","description":"Segundo as Belas e Precisas Profecias de Agnes Nutter, o mundo vai acabar num sábado.

De volta à Inglaterra, após bem-sucedidas missões na Índia e na Espanha, a carreira do oficial parece chegar ao fim. Longe da amada Lady Grace e relegado ao posto de intendente, Sharpe recebe uma arriscada tarefa: fazer companhia a John Lavisser, nobre oficial que vai a Copenhague subornar o príncipe-herdeiro dinamarquês, e com isso impedir uma nova guerra.<br />A Dinamarca é dona de uma frota mercante gigantesca, protegida por uma marinha imbatível. No porto de Copenhague, embarcações chegam e partem dia e noite, em um movimento somente inferior aos portos ingleses. Derrotados na Batalha de Trafalgar, os franceses planejam tomar a capital dinamarquesa e se apossar de toda a armada nacional, substituindo os navios perdidos na costa espanhola em outubro de 1805. Os ingleses agora devem impedi-los.<br />Richard Sharpe recebe a ordem de proteger Lavisser contra os agentes franceses espalhados por toda a Copenhague. É uma acirrada guerra de bastidores, onde espiões e a mais pura brutalidade são moeda corrente. E nesse terrível cenário, Sharpe é um peão destinado ao sacrifício. Mas algumas vezes os peões podem mudar o jogo. Quando Sharpe descobre um traidor em seu meio, cria as próprias regras, lançando-se em uma luta feroz para se manter vivo.","published":"2010","authors":[{"id":"b06f2737-284b-51ed-a58e-aacae4fb56f8"}]}},{"node":{"id":"905761ab-1fd7-555f-a882-c5201e81cd49","title":"O vampiro Armand (As crônicas vampirescas, #6)","title_without_series":"O vampiro Armand","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1279116835m/6463606.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1279116835s/6463606.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6463606-o-vampiro-armand","num_pages":"372","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Rocco","publication_day":"","publication_month":"9","publication_year":"2000","average_rating":"3.75","ratings_count":"60480","description":"<i>Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN 10: 8532510892</i><br /><br />O sedutor Armand, que despontou em Entrevista com o vampiro, hoje um clássico do horror gótico, retorna para contar sua fascinante trajetória de vida em mais um episódio das Crônicas Vampirescas. Tudo começa onde o romance Memnoch (quinto livro da série) termina. Vampiros do mundo inteiro estão reunidos em torno de Lestat, prostrado no chão de uma catedral, não se sabe se morto ou em coma.<br /><br />Enquanto reflete sobre a condição de Lestat, Armand é convidado pelo jornalista David Talbot para contar a sua vida. A narrativa passa então abruptamente para o século XV, em Kiev Rus — uma cidade em ruínas dominada pelos mongóis onde Armand vive a sua infância — e depois para Constantinopla, onde ele é vendido como escravo por caçadores tártaros. Seu comprador é um Marius, um misterioso pintor veneziano (também vampiro). Ele é quem dará a Armand o dom da imortalidade.<br /><br />A autora descreve em detalhes o sensual relacionamento do ainda mortal Armand com o seu mentor e a conseqüente transformação do pupilo em vampiro. Quando esta finalmente ocorre, as cenas fortes de sexo são substituídas pelo questionamento de Armand, forçado a escolher entre a imortalidade adquirida e a salvação de sua alma.<br /><br />O romance descreve cenas de luxo e elegância no suntuoso palácio renascentista de Marius, em Veneza, passa para mirabolantes aventuras e cultos diabólicos na Paris do século XIX, até chegar à Nova Orleans de hoje. Os capítulos finais relembram o significado profundo dos vampiros de Anne Rice: uma metáfora para os mais intensos e ocultos desejos do ser humano.","published":"2000","authors":[{"id":"05172442-aa64-50c2-8cdd-168918ade32a"}]}},{"node":{"id":"020cf9e0-52a1-552f-835a-d4e752c71d2a","title":"Roverandom","title_without_series":"Roverandom","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1374681558m/23617.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1374681558s/23617.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23617.Roverandom","num_pages":"116","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"HarperCollins Publishers","publication_day":"2","publication_month":"9","publication_year":"2002","average_rating":"3.87","ratings_count":"10046","description":"<b>A classic children's story by the author of <i>The Hobbit</i></b><br /><br /><i>Rover should never have bitten the wizard's trousers.

But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative, visionary book, such an approach only perpetuates the one-way, \"cradle to grave\" manufacturing model, dating to the Industrial Revolution, that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective.<br /><br /><b>Waste equals food.</b><br /><br />Guided by this principle, McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as \"biological nutrients\" that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be \"technical nutrients\" that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closed-loop industrial cycles, rather than being \"recycled\" -- really, downcycled -- into low-grade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice, and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well. <br /><br /><b>William McDonough</b> is an architect and the founding principal of William McDonough + Partners, Architecture and Community Design, based in Charlottesville, Virginia. From 1994 to 1999 he served as dean of the school of architecture at the University of Virginia. In 1999 <i>Time</i> magazine recognized him as a \"Hero for the Planet,\" stating that \"his utopianism is grounded in a unified philosophy that -- in demonstrable and practical ways -- is changing the design of the world.\" In 1996, he received the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development, the highest environmental honor given by the United States.<br /><br /><b>Michael Braungart</b> is a chemist and the founder of the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency (EPEA) in Hamburg, Germany. Prior to starting EPEA, he was the director of the chemistry section for Greenpeace. Since 1984 he has been lecturing at universities, businesses, and institutions around the world on critical new concepts for ecological chemistry and materials flow management. Dr. Braungart is the recipient of numerous honors, awards, and fellowships from the Heinz Endowment, the W. Alton Jones Foundation, and other organizations.<br /><br />In 1995 the authors created McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry, a product and systems development firm assisting client companies in implementing their unique sustaining design protocol. Their clients include Ford Motor Company, Nike, Herman Miller, BASF, DesignTex, Pendleton, Volvo, and the city of Chicago.","published":"2002","authors":[{"id":"8ecec4a8-45ac-52d2-82f0-2d0c29035012"}]}},{"node":{"id":"7ae0dd21-c570-569e-a6f9-12057e800577","title":"The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn","title_without_series":"The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering","num_pages":"376","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"CRC Press","publication_day":"28","publication_month":"10","publication_year":"1997","average_rating":"4.34","ratings_count":"111","description":"Highly effective thinking is an art that engineers and scientists can be taught to develop.

Focusing on the use of language as both a vehicle and a tool to shape persuasive argument, Aristotle delineates with remarkable insight both practical and aesthetic elements and their proper combination in an effective presentation, oral or written. He also emphasizes the role of language in achieving precision and clarity of thought.<br />The ancients regarded rhetoric as the crowning intellectual discipline — the synthesis of logical principles and other knowledge attained from years of schooling. Modern readers will find considerable relevance in Aristotelian rhetoric and its focus on developing persuasive tools of argumentation. Aristotle's examinations of how to compose and interpret speeches offer significant insights into the language and style of contemporary communications, from advertisements to news reports and other media.","published":"2012","authors":[{"id":"a4bd3b9b-5885-5096-a57f-d29737361558"}]}},{"node":{"id":"537731e7-8e50-52f2-9efd-7451295ded5e","title":"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days","title_without_series":"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1457284924m/25814544.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1457284924s/25814544.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814544-sprint","num_pages":"274","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Simon  Schuster","publication_day":"8","publication_month":"3","publication_year":"2016","average_rating":"4.23","ratings_count":"6785","description":"From three design partners at Google Ventures, a unique five-day process for solving tough problems using design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers.<br /><br />The startups that Google Ventures invest in face big questions every day: Where’s the most important place to focus your effort, and how do you start? What will your ideas look like in real life? How many meetings and discussions does it take before you can be sure you have the right solution to a problem? Business owners and investors want their companies and the people who lead them to be equipped to answer these questions—and quickly. And now there’s a sure-fire way to solve their problems and test solutions: the sprint.<br /><br />While working at Google, designer Jake Knapp created a unique problem-solving method that he coined a “design sprint”—a five-day process to help companies answer crucial questions. His ‘sprints’ were used on everything from Google Search to Chrome to Google X. When he moved to Google Ventures, he joined Braden Kowitz and John Zeratsky, both designers and partners there who worked on products like YouTube and Gmail. Together Knapp, Zeratsky, and Kowitz have run over 100 sprints with their portfolio companies. They’ve seen firsthand how sprints can overcome challenges in all kinds of companies: healthcare, fitness, finance, retailers, and more.<br /><br />A practical guide to answering business questions, Sprint is a book for groups of any size, from small startups to Fortune 100s, from teachers to non-profits. It’s for anyone with a big opportunity, problem, or idea who needs to get answers today.","published":"2016","authors":[{"id":"614d8fb5-f0a9-5b31-b17c-0283bef38896"}]}},{"node":{"id":"0b7bbcc3-cece-5b05-bf75-87f69a39ea26","title":"How to Make Sense of Any Mess: Information Architecture for Everybody","title_without_series":"How to Make Sense of Any Mess: Information Architecture for Everybody","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23557020-how-to-make-sense-of-any-mess","num_pages":"174","format":"","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_month":"","publication_year":null,"average_rating":"3.83","ratings_count":"742","description":"","published":null,"authors":[{"id":"906a1842-05d8-5441-a996-5ad33f2dabcf"}]}},{"node":{"id":"89bfa45f-1981-5be3-a5bc-572fc836a613","title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","title_without_series":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1490961555m/17744.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1490961555s/17744.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17744.The_Visual_Display_of_Quantitative_Information","num_pages":"197","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"2nd","publisher":"Graphics","publication_day":"","publication_month":"","publication_year":"2001","average_rating":"4.41","ratings_count":"6316","description":"The classic book on statistical graphics, charts, tables.

Users demand software that is well-behaved, good-looking, and easy to use. Your clients or managers demand originality and a short time to market. Your UI technology -- web applications, desktop software, even mobile devices -- may give you the tools you need, but little guidance on how to use them well.<br /><br />UI designers over the years have refined the art of interface design, evolving many best practices and reusable ideas. If you learn these, and understand why the best user interfaces work so well, you too can design engaging and usable interfaces with less guesswork and more confidence.<br /><br /><i>Designing Interfaces</i> captures those best practices as design patterns -- solutions to common design problems, tailored to the situation at hand. Each pattern contains practical advice that you can put to use immediately, plus a variety of examples illustrated in full color. You'll get recommendations, design alternatives, and warnings on when not to use them.<br /><br />Each chapter's introduction describes key design concepts that are often misunderstood, such as affordances, visual hierarchy, navigational distance, and the use of color. These give you a deeper understanding of why the patterns work, and how to apply them with more insight.<br /><br />A book can't design an interface for you -- no foolproof design process is given here -- but <i>Designing Interfaces</i> does give you concrete ideas that you can mix and recombine as you see fit. Experienced designers can use it as a sourcebook of ideas. Novice designers will find a roadmap to the world of interface and interaction design, with enough guidance to start using these patterns immediately.","published":"2005","authors":[{"id":"18004558-f794-59be-ba94-493490a249b6"}]}},{"node":{"id":"82fab16b-71aa-5343-a47c-b9231a968366","title":"Michael Faraday and the Electrical Century","title_without_series":"Michael Faraday and the Electrical Century","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36128409-michael-faraday-and-the-electrical-century","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_month":"","publication_year":null,"average_rating":"3.30","ratings_count":"10","description":"The only scientist to ever appear on the British twenty pound note, Michael Faraday is one of the most recognisable names in the history of science.<br /><br />Faraday's forte was electricity, a revolutionary force in nineteenth-century society.

Defeated comprehensively by the Vikings who now occupy most of England, Alfred and his very small group of surviving followers retreat to the trackless marshlands of Somerset. There, forced to move restlessly to escape betrayal or detection, using the marsh mists for cover, they travel by small boats from one island refuge to another, hoping that they can regroup and find some more strength and support. Only Uhtred remains resolute. Determined to discover the enemy's strategies, he draws once again on his Viking upbringing, and attempts to enter the Viking camps. His plan is to become accepted by their leaders, and to sit in their councils and uncover their plans. But once there, the attractions of his many friends among the Vikings coupled with his disillusion with the Saxons' leadership and anger at Alfred's criticism of his own conduct, draws him back again to his allegiance to the Vikings. The Pale Horseman, an even more powerful and dramatic book than The Last Kingdom, brings both Uhtred and the Saxons' dilemmas vividly to life.","published":"2006","authors":[{"id":"b06f2737-284b-51ed-a58e-aacae4fb56f8"}]}},{"node":{"id":"ddc7d84d-71ac-57bb-9dea-b61d440b4e89","title":"The Caves of Steel (Robot, #1)","title_without_series":"The Caves of Steel","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1338230501m/1637041.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1338230501s/1637041.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1637041.The_Caves_of_Steel","num_pages":"272","format":"Mass Market Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Del Rey","publication_day":"12","publication_month":"10","publication_year":"1986","average_rating":"4.15","ratings_count":"66203","description":"A millennium into the future, two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain.

It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the <i>Toy Story</i> trilogy, <i>Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, </i>and<i> WALL-E, </i>which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really <i>is</i>. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.<br />  <br /> As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, <i>Toy Story</i> was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:<br />  <br /> • Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.<br /> • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. <br /> • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.<br /> • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. <br /> • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.<br /> • Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change—it takes substantial energy to move a group, even when all are on board.","published":"2014","authors":[{"id":"577e0322-f4c2-5e6c-adef-c64d8ae8a513"}]}},{"node":{"id":"fb3479a5-62fd-5948-9dcc-f7104714d43e","title":"Leaf by Niggle","title_without_series":"Leaf by Niggle","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1470461333m/31359056.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1470461333s/31359056.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31359056-leaf-by-niggle","num_pages":"58","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Harper Collins","publication_day":"","publication_month":"","publication_year":"2016","average_rating":"4.22","ratings_count":"2726","description":"Leaf by Niggle is a short story about a painter whom is working on a picture leaf by leaf.

In such a scenario, it makes sense to focus on the most identifiable and urgent problems, right? Actually, it doesn't. In his classic essay \"The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge,\" Abraham Flexner, the founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the man who helped bring Albert Einstein to the United States, describes a great paradox of scientific research. The search for answers to deep questions, motivated solely by curiosity and without concern for applications, often leads not only to the greatest scientific discoveries but also to the most revolutionary technological breakthroughs. In short, no quantum mechanics, no computer chips.<br /><br />This brief book includes Flexner's timeless 1939 essay alongside a new companion essay by Robbert Dijkgraaf, the Institute's current director, in which he shows that Flexner's defense of the value of \"the unobstructed pursuit of useless knowledge\" may be even more relevant today than it was in the early twentieth century. Dijkgraaf describes how basic research has led to major transformations in the past century and explains why it is an essential precondition of innovation and the first step in social and cultural change. He makes the case that society can achieve deeper understanding and practical progress today and tomorrow only by truly valuing and substantially funding the curiosity-driven \"pursuit of useless knowledge\" in both the sciences and the humanities.<br />----<br />Abraham Flexner (1866–1959) was the founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study, one of the world's leading institutions for basic research in the sciences and humanities. Robbert Dijkgraaf, a mathematical physicist who specializes in string theory, is director and Leon Levy Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study. A distinguished public policy adviser and passionate advocate for science and the arts, he is also the cochair of the InterAcademy Council, a global alliance of science academies, and former president of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.","published":"2017","authors":[{"id":"b69dfada-b3fb-54e8-b04e-2b3334bb3474"}]}},{"node":{"id":"991e5189-3fe2-5cb2-bbb2-49fbfb3651ae","title":"Seven Brief Lessons on Physics","title_without_series":"Seven Brief Lessons on Physics","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1462812719m/28284636.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1462812719s/28284636.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28284636-seven-brief-lessons-on-physics","num_pages":"94","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Penguin","publication_day":"30","publication_month":"6","publication_year":"2016","average_rating":"3.96","ratings_count":"22237","description":"<b>THE PHENOMENAL BESTSELLER</b><br /><br /><b>Everything you need to know about modern physics, the universe and our place in the world in seven enlightening lessons </b><br /><br />'Here, on the edge of what we know, in contact with the ocean of the unknown, shines the mystery and the beauty of the world.

Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In <em>Norse Mythology</em>, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of giants, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman’s deft and witty prose emerges the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to dupe others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.","published":"2017","authors":[{"id":"32df4a08-7ad4-5b6e-bd18-f25ceda36ab4"}]}},{"node":{"id":"48b0803c-26a6-579d-a4f9-085125f2617a","title":"Manual Tipográfico de Giambattista Bodoni","title_without_series":"Manual Tipográfico de Giambattista Bodoni","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336474920m/13639034.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336474920s/13639034.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13639034-manual-tipogr-fico-de-giambattista-bodoni","num_pages":"","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Almedina","publication_day":"","publication_month":"","publication_year":null,"average_rating":"0.0","ratings_count":"0","description":"","published":null,"authors":[{"id":"11d66629-c855-5177-ac6c-71b0eafd4822"}]}},{"node":{"id":"4d06c595-e333-507e-a4de-60fce6bebc0f","title":"The Lord of the Rings (The Lord of the Rings, #1-3)","title_without_series":"The Lord of the Rings","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1497757613m/31.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1497757613s/31.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31.The_Lord_of_the_Rings","num_pages":"1184","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"50th Anniversary Edition","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","publication_day":"21","publication_month":"10","publication_year":"2004","average_rating":"4.49","ratings_count":"481058","description":"The Fellowship of the Ring, part one of J.R.R.

A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br /><br />Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.<br /><br />A groundbreaking work from a master, <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.","published":"2013","authors":[{"id":"32df4a08-7ad4-5b6e-bd18-f25ceda36ab4"}]}},{"node":{"id":"2a14d8dc-7146-518c-84b7-de42c95866d9","title":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)","title_without_series":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451727490m/24548235.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451727490s/24548235.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24548235-harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone","num_pages":"248","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"UK Illustrated Edition","publisher":"Bloomsbury","publication_day":"6","publication_month":"10","publication_year":"2015","average_rating":"4.46","ratings_count":"5609808","description":"<i>Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28550610-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerer-s-stone\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></i><br /><br />Prepare to be spellbound by Jim Kay's dazzling depiction of the wizarding world and much loved characters in this full-colour illustrated hardback edition of the nation's favourite children's book – <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>.

Although she repeatedly refused to marry Yeats, Maud would become the object of his passion and his poetry. The emotional power in many of Yeats' early poems is shaped by the one-sidedness of his affair with Maud, but the poems themselves remain hopeful and bitter-sweet, pure in their language and attitudes about love.<br /><br />The forty-one poems collected in<i> A Poet to his Beloved</i> represent some of Yeats's most evocative and passionate early love poems.

It was fought by two badly matched armies that met in atrocious conditions on St Crispin's Day 1415, and resulted in an extraordinary victory that was celebrated in England long before Shakespeare immortalised it in <i>Henry V</i>. It has always been held to be the triumph of the longbow against the armoured knight, and of the common man against the feudal aristocrat, but those are history's myths. Bernard Cornwell, who has long wanted to write this story, depicts the reality behind the myths.<br /><br />Nicholas Hook is an English archer. He seems born to trouble and, when his lord orders him to London as part of a force sent to quell an expected Lollard uprising, Nick's headstrong behaviour leads to him being proscribed an outlaw. He finds refuge across the Channel, part of an English mercenary force protecting the town of Soissons against the French. What happened at the Siege of Soissons shocked all Europe, and propels Nick back to England where he is enrolled in the archer companyof the doughty Sir John Cornwaille, a leader of Henry V's army. The army was superb, but sickness and the unexpected French defiance at Harfleur, reduce it to near-shambolic condition. Henry stubbornly refuses to accept defeat and, in appalling weather, leads his shrunken force to what appears to be inevitable disaster.<br /><br /><i>Azincourt</i> culminates in the battle. Seen from several points of view on the English side, but also from the French ranks, the scene is vivid, convincing and compelling. Bernard Cornwell has a great understanding of men at war and battlefields and this is his masterpiece. This is what it must have been like to fight at Agincourt.","published":"2008","authors":[{"id":"b06f2737-284b-51ed-a58e-aacae4fb56f8"}]}},{"node":{"id":"cc8532a3-fc62-5b96-be57-0b755cbb2c6e","title":"When Giants Walked the Earth: A Biography of Led Zeppelin","title_without_series":"When Giants Walked the Earth: A Biography of Led Zeppelin","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1363815587m/6445709.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1363815587s/6445709.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6445709-when-giants-walked-the-earth","num_pages":"534","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Orion (an Imprint of the Orion Publishing Group LT","publication_day":"","publication_month":"","publication_year":"2009","average_rating":"3.93","ratings_count":"2670","description":"Veteran rock journalist Mick Wall unflinchingly tells the story of the band that pushed the envelope on both creativity and excess, even by rock'n roll standards.

If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.</b><br /><br />Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.<br /><br />In <i>Deep Work</i>, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four \"rules,\" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.<br /><br />A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, <i>Deep Work</i> takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. <i>Deep Work</i> is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.","published":"2016","authors":[{"id":"9f1f346f-10fd-54ae-be63-5293e16d7419"}]}},{"node":{"id":"dde879a1-bb95-5337-a157-1ec1150aed70","title":"Designing for Emotion","title_without_series":"Designing for Emotion","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12910715-designing-for-emotion","num_pages":"104","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"A Book Apart","publication_day":"18","publication_month":"10","publication_year":"2011","average_rating":"3.99","ratings_count":"2218","description":"Make your users fall in love with your site via the precepts packed into this brief, charming book by MailChimp user experience design lead Aarron Walter.

He won 35 world titles in less than five years. But through it all, his father looked down on his son's love for skating and pressured him to walk away from the sport and leave behind his fans and status as the most famous skateboarder of his era. After years of stress and conflict, Rodney gave in and promised his father he'd quit for good. But by the time he finally broke free from his suffocating and abusive home life, the popularity of freestyle had waned and given way to vert and street styles. So Rodney picked up his board and started from scratch. With the help of mentor Mike Ternansky, Rodney used his freestyle background to usher in a whole new era of street skating.<br /><br />Today Rodney is more popular than ever. The videos in his series Rodney Versus Daewon are among the most popular skateboard videos ever produced. He won the 2002 Transworld Skateboarding readers' choice award for favourite street skater and is the most popular character on the top–selling Tony Hawk's Pro Skater video games.","published":"2005","authors":[{"id":"1bd51474-60f5-591f-a508-3d8d7b17c39e"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{}}

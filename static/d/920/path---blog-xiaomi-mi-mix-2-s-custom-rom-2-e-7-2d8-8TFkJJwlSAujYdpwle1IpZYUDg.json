I was waiting for the release of the Pixel 3 but was a bit disappointed by that notch, not to mention the price.</p>\n<p>After doing some research on different models I picked a <strong>Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S</strong>. The built quality of this phone is outstanding, it supports wireless charging, has 6GB of RAM, Snapdragon 845, and most importantly: it has no notch.</p>\n<p>There <em>is</em> a problem though: it comes with the disgusting, horrible MIUI. Why would they ruin such a good piece of hardware? The whole <em>Android-trying-to-be-iOS</em> thing really doesn't work IMHO… inspired by Linus’ video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsHtfLh6azw\">how to turn the Pocophone into a Pixel</a> I deviced to do the same with my Xiaomi, and here are the instructions so you can do the same!</p>\n<p>For this guide you will need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2L7VXPl\">Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s/development/rom-pixel-experience-t3872863\">Pixel Experience ROM</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-bsg/\">Google Camera app</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Got everything you need? Cool! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBcAXP1QjEs\">Let the hacking commence!</a>!</p>\n<h2>1. Unlocking the Bootloader 🔓</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable <strong>Developer Tools</strong> on your device by going to <code class=\"language-text\">Settings › About Phone</code>, and tapping on <code class=\"language-text\">MIUI Version</code> for about 7-10 times. You should see a message saying “You are now a developer”.</li>\n<li>Enable <strong>OEM unlocking</strong> option on your device by going to <code class=\"language-text\">Settings › Additional Settings › Developer Tools</code>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.miui.com/unlock/download_en.html\">Download the Mi Unlock tool</a> and sign in to your [Mi Account].(<a href=\"https://global.account.xiaomi.com/pass/register\">https://global.account.xiaomi.com/pass/register</a>)</li>\n<li>Shut down your phone, and hold <code class=\"language-text\">volume down</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">power button</code> to enter Fastboot Mode.</li>\n<li>Connect your phone to your PC using a USB cable and click “Unlock”. If you just got the phone, you might need to wait 72 hours after the account was created in order to unlock it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>2. Installing the custom ROM 👨‍💻</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your bootloader unlocked, you're free to do whatever you want with your device. Head over to XDA and <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s/development/rom-pixel-experience-t3872863\">follow the steps to install your Pixel Experience ROM</a>.</p>\n<p>The device should performs exactly the same – if not better, and the clean Android UI fits the hardware like a glove.</p>\n<h2>3. Installing Google’s Camera App 🤳</h2>\n<p>The best thing about the Pixel is the camera, and surprisingly what really makes the camera shine is the software, not the hardware. Some developers have taken Google's Camera software and ported to different devices. After lots of tests, I found out that the ones developed by <a href=\"https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-bsg/\">BSG</a> perform great with the Pixel Experience ROM, specially the <code class=\"language-text\">MGC_6.1.021_MI8_Vc.apk</code>.</p>\n<p>Seriously, the image quality is at least 50% better than the pre-installed camera app. Portrait mode works great!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this crude guide! Truth be told, the main reason I'm posting this here is for <em>Future Ed’s</em> benefit, in case he needs to do it again.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The notchless Pixel","date":"07 Dec 2018","tags":["Android","Hacking"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s-custom-rom/"}}

His accessible style and far-reaching interests in subjects ranging from science to humor to history earned him the nickname \"the Great Explainer.\" <i>I. Asimov</i> is his personal story—vivid, open, and honest—as only Asimov himself could tell it.<br /><br />Here is the story of the paradoxical genius who wrote of travel to the stars yet refused to fly in airplanes; who imagined alien universes and vast galactic civilizations while staying home to write; who compulsively authored more than 470 books yet still found the time to share his ideas with some of the great minds of our century. Here are his wide-ranging thoughts and sharp-eyed observations on everything from religion to politics, love and divorce, friendship and Hollywood, fame and mortality. Here, too, is a riveting behind-the-scenes look at the varied personalities—Campbell, Ellison, Heinlein, Clarke, del Rey, Silverberg, and others—who along with Asimov helped shape science fiction.<br /><br />As unique and irrepressible as the man himself, <i>I. Asimov</i> is the candid memoir of an incomparable talent who entertained readers for nearly half a century and whose work will surely endure into the future he so vividly envisioned."}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}

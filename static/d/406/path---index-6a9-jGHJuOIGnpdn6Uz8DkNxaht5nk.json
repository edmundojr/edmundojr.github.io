The built quality of this phone is outstanding, it supports wireless charging, has 6GB of RAM, Snapdragon 845, and most importantly: it has no notch.</p>\n<p>There <em>is</em> a problem though: it comes with that horrible MIUI. What I don't get it, is why would they ruin such a good piece of hardware? The whole <em>Android-trying-to-be-iOS</em> thing really doesn't work IMHO‚Ä¶ so inspired by Linus‚Äô video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsHtfLh6azw\">how to turn the Pocophone into a Pixel</a> I deviced to do the same with the Mi Mix 2S.</p>\n<p>For this guide you will need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2L7VXPl\">Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s/development/rom-pixel-experience-t3872863\">Pixel Experience ROM</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-bsg/\">Google Camera app</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Got everything you need? Cool! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBcAXP1QjEs\">Let the hacking commence!</a>!</p>\n<h2>1. Unlocking the Bootloader</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable <strong>Developer Tools</strong> on your device by going to <code class=\"language-text\">Settings ‚Ä∫ About Phone</code>, and tapping on <code class=\"language-text\">MIUI Version</code> for about 7-10 times. You should see a message saying ‚ÄúYou are now a developer‚Äù.</li>\n<li>Enable the <strong>OEM unlocking</strong> option on your device by going to <code class=\"language-text\">Settings ‚Ä∫ Additional Settings ‚Ä∫ Developer Tools</code>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.miui.com/unlock/download_en.html\">Download the Mi Unlock tool</a> and sign in to your <a href=\"https://global.account.xiaomi.com/pass/register\">Mi Account</a>.</li>\n<li>Shut down your phone and hold <code class=\"language-text\">volume down</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">power button</code> to enter Fastboot Mode.</li>\n<li>Connect your phone to your PC using a USB cable and click ‚ÄúUnlock‚Äù.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your phone is now unlocked! You will see a ‚ÄúUnlocked‚Äù message when turning on the phone. By the way, if you just got the phone you might need to wait 72 hours after the account was created in order to unlock it.</p>\n<h2>2. Installing the custom ROM</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your bootloader unlocked, you're free to do whatever you want with your device. Head over to XDA and follow the steps to <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s/development/rom-pixel-experience-t3872863\">install the Pixel Experience ROM</a>.</p>\n<p>The device should performs exactly the same ‚Äì if not better, and the clean Android UI fits the hardware like a glove.</p>\n<h2>3. Installing Google‚Äôs Camera App</h2>\n<p>It's no secret that the best thing about the Pixel is the camera, and what plays a big part in making the camera perform so well is the software. Some developers have taken Pixel's Camera app and ported to a wide range of devices.</p>\n<p>After some testing, I found out that the apps ones ported by <a href=\"https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-bsg/\">BSG</a> perform great with the Pixel Experience ROM, specifically the <code class=\"language-text\">MGC_6.1.021_MI8_Vc</code> apk.</p>\n<p>The image quality is way better than the one you get with the original camera app. It comes out-of-the-box with Portrait Mode, Google Lens, and Night Sight.

Many organisations separate design from the development process, with designers handing static screens and prototypes to engineers ‚Äî and in worst-case scenarios designers and engineers don‚Äôt even sit together. In the world of interactive design, functionality should play a significant role in the design process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Code shouldn't hurt your creativity. <strong>It should enhance it.</strong></p>\n<footer>‚Äî Benjamin De Cock, on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6wUmQDQBkw\">Let‚Äôs Move</a></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Knowing how to code allows you to make smarter decisions as a designer, it will help you to bring additional value to your work and projects. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to write production-ready code, but you should at least know about it as you will gain an understanding of the challenges an engineer faces.</p>\n<p>Now‚Ä¶ should engineers design? Isn‚Äôt the opposite true? I‚Äôd say maybe not designing screens <em>per se</em>, but they should definitely be part of feedback calls with customers. Listening to those calls help us better understand how the user feels about the product, what are their pain points, and what are the bits they love, so everyone benefits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôd say 25% of the real design work happens after a designer hands off their designs. That‚Äôs when engineers start pressure testing your designs, and they‚Äôll find new constraints and edge cases you never expected.</p>\n<footer>‚Äî John Saito, on <a href=\"https://medium.com/dropbox-design/how-to-stay-scrappy-9c42af21c996\">How to stay scrappy</a></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So my advice to you, fellow designer, is to learn how to code. Think of coding as another tool in your design tool belt. Start small with HTML and CSS, throw something together in the browser to quickly test an idea or model an aspect of how the interface should behave. Then take up a notch with JavaScript and you will be surprised at what you can achieve. Even if your code doesn‚Äôt get shipped, think of it as a communication tool, hand it to engineers to demonstrate how the interface should function ‚Äî it will always be better than still images.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We spend hours designing for a medium that‚Äôs interactive and responsive, but we start by producing mockups that are static and inflexible. If great design is not only aesthetics but also how it works, then it‚Äôs time to make development part of the creative process.</p>\n<footer>‚Äî Jeremy Bell, on <a href=\"https://www.teehanlax.com/blog/designing-with-code/\">Designing with Code</a></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So that‚Äôs my take on the ‚Äúshould designers code‚Äù debate. In the end, it's not about your job title, but about your responsabilities.

They enhance the emotional experience, bringing delight and adding personality to your interface. In fact, to animate means bring to life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Emotional design‚Äôs primary goal is to facilitate human-to-human communication. If we‚Äôre doing our job well, the computer recedes into the background, and personalities rise to the surface.</p>\n<footer>‚Äî Aarron Walter, Designing For Emotion</footer>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>No animation is unnatural</h2>\n<p>You click on a ‚ÄúNew‚Äù button and a form just‚Ä¶ appears from nowhere? You click a ‚ÄúX‚Äù to close a modal and‚Ä¶ it just vanishes into thin air? That is unnatural and it‚Äôs what we should be avoiding as designers. Nothing in the real world does anything as jarringly as just swapping states. If that happened it would feel like a glitch in the matrix.</p>\n<p>Take for instance the carousel interface below: without any animations, could you tell that it is indeed a carousel interface? Are we offering the user any clues other than changing the background color and emoji when we swap the panels?</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n  <iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" height=\"310\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"CSS 3D transform Colorful Animated Carousel\" src=\"//codepen.io/edmundojr/embed/qdLWWx/?height=383&theme-id=33557&default-tab=result&embed-version=2\" frameborder=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>If you toggle the animation (go on, I wait), you'll see how much nicer it is to understand the relationship between the  elements and the flow between different states ‚Äì you instantly get a sense of depth of the interface, it feels faster, it is now enjoybable‚Ä¶ you feel that it is truly alive. üòä</p>\n<h2>What makes a good animation</h2>\n<p>So we know we should animate, but what makes for a good animation? What should we focus on?</p>\n<p>First of all, you should animate exclusively using <code class=\"language-text\">opacity</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">transform</code> properties, anything else will trigger a browser layout or paint, which are expensive operations. That's the only way to keep your animations running at a smooth 60fps rate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The process that the browser goes through is pretty simple: calculate the styles that apply to the elements (Recalculate Style), generate the geometry and position for each element (Layout), fill out the pixels for each element into layers (Paint Setup and Paint) and draw the layers out to screen (Composite Layers). To achieve silky smooth animations you need to avoid work, and the best way to do that is to only change properties that affect compositing -- transform and opacity. The <strong>higher up</strong> you start on the timeline waterfall the <strong>more work</strong> the browser has to do to get pixels on to the screen.</p>\n<footer><span>‚Äî</span> Paul Lewis and Paul Irish, <a href=\"https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/#disqus_thread\">High Performance Animations</a></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, animation is all about timing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to <strong>keep your animations fast</strong>: usually around the <em>300ms</em> mark</li>\n<li><strong>Animate things independently</strong>: stagger individual elements instead of animating big blocks</li>\n<li>Always <strong>use custom easings</strong>: the default ones are crap</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's about it. Remember that having fun is the best way to get the best results. Go the extra mile, play, experiment, and be happy with what you do.

FirefoxDeveloperEdition has some <a href=\"https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/css-grid\">excellent tools</a> for working with CSS Grid layout, I highly recommend it.</p>\n<p>Here's a list of things I plan to do next with this website, in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a <strong>library</strong> page with books I'm reading, books I've read, and books I'm gonna read</li>\n<li>Write <strong>articles</strong> about stuff I'm working on, what I'm learning, or whatever I feel like writing really</li>\n<li>It would be cool to have a <strong>photography</strong> page where I can share some of my pics too, definitely going to copy some ideas from <a href=\"https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/\">@stammy's website</a></li>\n<li>Build an <strong>about</strong> page (meh)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The website is not fully responsive yet and there are probably lots of bugs, but oh well. Please <a href=\"https://github.com/edmundojr/edmundojr.github.io/issues/new\">report</a> if you find any bugs. üêõ</p>\n<p>On each and every one of the blogs I've started in the past I posted this quote, so here it is again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúThe scariest moment is always just before you start.

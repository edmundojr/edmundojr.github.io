The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day, the guide suggests, and try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part is easy. All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it’s going to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;— Stephen King&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On each and every one of the blogs that I’d started in the past, I posted this quote. Why this quote, Galadriel? &lt;q&gt;Perhaps it is because I am afraid, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFcYobgbFTM&quot;&gt;it gives me courage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

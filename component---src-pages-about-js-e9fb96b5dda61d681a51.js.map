I guess my journey is\n                similar to others, Iâ€™ve started my career as a finished artist â€“\n                which entails checking for mistakes and configuring artwork for\n                print production, and after a little while I moved to graphic\n                design, designing pretty much everything that could be printed\n                on paper â€“ book design, brand design, business cards, the lot! I\n                work as a graphic designer for about 5 years or so.\n              </p>{' '}\n              <p>\n                On that same job I had the opportunity to design and develop the\n                companyâ€™s website (mostly because the company didnâ€™t have anyone\n                else to do it), and I immediatilly fell in love with UI design,\n                both the design and implementation aspects of it.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                From that point onward, I change my focus to UI design and\n                development. It was not a big change really, as most of the\n                skills were still valid and transferable from my previous life\n                as a graphic designer. What was really new and exciting was\n                getting to implement and code the UIs I would come up with,\n                playing with different transitions and animationsâ€¦ basically\n                lots of fun!\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                For the next 5 years I worked mostly doing web design and\n                front-end development, and with every website I did I would\n                focus more and more on the user experience side of things, which\n                finally brought me to UI/UX design.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Today I considered myself a product designer, and my routine\n                consists of researching, designing, prototyping, coding, user\n                testingâ€¦ all of the UI/UX keywords really!\n              </p>\n              <p>If you made this far, thanks!

Happy days: today I'm releasing a new version of my website! 🎉

I decided to throw away the [previous one (✦ 2014 - ♱ 2018)](https://github.com/edmundojr/edmundojr-2014) and build this one from scratch using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static site generator for React.js.

Because I was already learning about the new CSS Grid system, I decided to use it for designing this baby. I started with some rough sketches on Sketch (ah ha!) and then moved on to design in the browser. FirefoxDeveloperEdition has some [excellent tools](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/css-grid) for working with CSS Grid layout, I highly recommend it.

Here's a list of things I plan to do next with this website, in no particular order:

- Build a **library** page with books I'm reading, books I've read, and books I'm gonna read
- Write **articles** about stuff I'm working on, what I'm learning, or whatever I feel like writing really
- It would be cool to have a **photography** page where I can share some of my pics too, definitely going to copy some ideas from [@stammy's website](https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/)
- Build an **about** page (meh)

The website is not fully responsive yet and there are probably lots of bugs, but oh well. Please [report](https://github.com/edmundojr/edmundojr.github.io/issues/new) if you find any bugs. 🐛

On each and every one of the blogs I've started in the past I posted this quote, so here it is again:

> “The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better.”

That's it for today, [let me know](https://twitter.com/edmundojr_) what you think.

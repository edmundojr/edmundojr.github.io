> There is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration—that there is some strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who knows where… but I hope [my work] makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.

I'm currently reading **Deep Work** by Cal Newport and found this great piece of advice. There's an [article by David Brooks](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/opinion/david-brooks-routine-creativity-and-president-obamas-un-speech.html) in which he summarizes this more blunty, saying that you should <q>think like an artist but work like an accountant.</q>

If you feel like distractions are hurting your productivity, [go buy this book](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), I can't recommend it enough.

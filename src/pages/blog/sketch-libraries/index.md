Last week I gave a talk (my first!) at the [UX Cork](https://www.meetup.com/UX-Cork/) meetup group. Although I was a bit nervous about doing the talk at first, it all went okay â€“ I think!

The talk was focused on Sketch Libraries, and how can help you improve your design workflow and collaboration with other designers.

You can [download the slides](https://cloudup.com/ckuvbdbBBCT) for the talk if you want. Hope it helps! ðŸ˜Š

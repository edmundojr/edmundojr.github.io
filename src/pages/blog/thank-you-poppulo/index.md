Some personal news: After 3.5 years at [Poppulo](https://poppulo.com/) my time has come to move on… I’m joining [evervault](https://evervault.com/) as VP of Colouring to help make _data privacy simple_.

I’m super proud of how the Poppulo platform moved forward in these last few years, especially of [how far the mobile product has come](https://www.poppulo.com/blog/how-poppulo-helped-sse-get-vital-news-to-employees-before-the-media-got-the-story/) and I can’t wait to see where the product is heading.

At Poppulo there was never a dull day, it has been incredibly fun and I had some of the best times of my career. The people at Poppulo are fantastic and I wish everyone continued success in the future.

For everyone at Poppulo, thanks again for everything and best wishes for the future!

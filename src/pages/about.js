      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m multi-disciplinary designer from Brazil, currently working and living in <s>Dublin</s> Cork, Ireland. I
        guess my journey is similar to others, Iâ€™ve started my career as a finished artist â€“ which entails checking
        for mistakes and configuring artwork for print production, and after a little while I moved to graphic
        design, designing pretty much everything that could be printed on paper â€“ book design, brand design,
        business cards, the lot! I work as a graphic designer for about 5 years or so.
      </p>{' '}
      <p>
        On that same job I had the opportunity to design and develop the companyâ€™s website (mostly because the
        company didnâ€™t have anyone else to do it), and I immediatilly fell in love with UI design, both the design
        and implementation aspects of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that point onward, I change my focus to UI design and development. It was not a big change really, as
        most of the skills were still valid and transferable from my previous life as a graphic designer. What was
        really new and exciting was getting to implement and code the UIs I would come up with, playing with
        different transitions and animationsâ€¦ basically lots of fun!
      </p>
      <p>
        For the next 5 years I worked mostly doing web design and front-end development, and with every website I
        did I would focus more and more on the user experience side of things, which finally brought me to UI/UX
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I considered myself a product designer, and my routine consists of researching, designing,
        prototyping, coding, user testingâ€¦ all of the UI/UX keywords really!
      </p>
      <p>If you made this far, thanks! I hope you find a better use of your time in the future! ðŸ˜…</p>

They enhance the emotional experience, bringing delight and adding personality to your interface. In fact, to animate means bring to life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Emotional design‚Äôs primary goal is to facilitate human-to-human communication. If we‚Äôre doing our job well, the computer recedes into the background, and personalities rise to the surface.\n‚Äî Aarron Walter, Designing For Emotion</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>No animation is unnatural</h2>\n<p>You click on a ‚ÄúNew‚Äù button and a form just‚Ä¶ appears from nowhere? You click a ‚ÄúX‚Äù to close a modal and‚Ä¶ it just vanishes out of thin air? That is unnatural and it‚Äôs what we should be avoiding as designers. Nothing in the real world does anything as jarringly as just swapping states. If that happened it would feel like a glitch in the matrix.</p>\n<p>Animations help the user understand the flow between two states and they make your app feels faster.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A good animation should amplify the behaviour and consolidate the relationship between different elements.\nBenjamin De Dock</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What makes a good animation</h2>\n<p>So we know we should animate, but what makes for a good animation? What should we focus on?</p>\n<iframe height='340' scrolling='no' title='Widget animation' src='//codepen.io/edmundojr/embed/zEobzx/?height=399&theme-id=33557&default-tab=result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>\n<p>First of all, you should animate exclusively using <code class=\"language-text\">opacity</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">transform</code> properties, anything else will trigger a browser layout or paint, which are expensive operations. That‚Äôs the only way to keep your animations running at a smooth 60fps rate. Here‚Äôs how the browser renders things:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The process that the browser goes through is pretty simple: calculate the styles that apply to the elements (Recalculate Style), generate the geometry and position for each element (Layout), fill out the pixels for each element into layers (Paint Setup and Paint) and draw the layers out to screen (Composite Layers). To achieve silky smooth animations you need to avoid work, and the best way to do that is to only change properties that affect compositing ‚Äî transform and opacity. <strong>The <em>higher up</em> you start on the timeline waterfall the <em>more work</em> the browser has to do to get pixels on to the screen.</strong> ‚Äî Paul Lewis and Paul Irish, <a href=\"https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/#disqus_thread\">High Performance Animations</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, animation is all about timing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to <strong>keep your animations fast</strong>: usually around the <em>300ms</em> mark</li>\n<li><strong>Animate things independently</strong>: stagger individual elements instead of animating big blocks</li>\n<li>Always <strong>use custom easings</strong>: the default ones are crap</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That‚Äôs about it. Remember that having fun is the best way to get the best results. Go the extra mile, play, experiment, and be happy with what you do. Try, iterate, and polish!</p>",frontmatter:{date:"21 May 2018",title:"Why animate?",tags:["Design, Animation"]}}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/blog/the-scariest-moment/"},html:'<p>Happy days: today I‚Äôm releasing a new version of my website! üéâ</p>\n<p>I decided to throw away the <a href="https://github.com/edmundojr/edmundojr-2014">previous one (‚ú¶ 2014 - ‚ô± 2018)</a> and build this one from scratch using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a>, a static site generator for React.js.</p>\n<p>Because I was already learning about the new CSS Grid system, I decided to use it for designing this baby. I started with some rough sketches on Sketch (ah ha!) and then moved on to design in the browser.

I'm usually looking for inspiration and I am always curious to see what he is working on at any given moment.</p>\n<p>Here’s some reading advice that stuck with me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s tempting to judge what you read:</p>\n<p><strong>I agree with these statements, and I disagree with those.</strong></p>\n<p>However, a great thinker who has spent decades on an unusual line of thought cannot induce their context into your head in a few pages. It’s almost certainly the case that you don’t fully understand their statements.</p>\n<p>Instead, you can say:</p>\n<p><strong>I have now learned that there exists a worldview in which all of these statements are consistent.</strong></p>\n<p>And if it feels worthwhile, you can make a genuine effort to understand that entire worldview. You don't have to adopt it. Just make it available to yourself, so you can make connections to it when it's needed.”</p>\n<footer>— Bret Victor, <a href=\"http://worrydream.com/Links2013/\">Links 2013</a></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Found this on his <a href=\"http://worrydream.com/Links2013/\">2013 links page</a>, you'll find additional reading tips and a fair amount of book recommendations and links about <q>powerful seeing, and powerful representations for scientific thinking</q>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Reading Tip‌‌‌‌ #1","date":"May 29, 2018","tags":["Reading","Quotes"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/reading-tip/"}}}

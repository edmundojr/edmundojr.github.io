I started with some rough sketches on Sketch (ah ha!) and then moved on to design in the browser. FirefoxDeveloperEdition has some <a href=\"https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/css-grid\">excellent tools</a> for working with CSS Grid layout, I highly recommend it.</p>\n<p>Here's a list of things I plan to do next with this website, in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a <strong>library</strong> page with books I'm reading, books I've read, and books I'm gonna read</li>\n<li>Write <strong>articles</strong> about stuff I'm working on, what I'm learning, or whatever I feel like writing really</li>\n<li>It would be cool to have a <strong>photography</strong> page where I can share some of my pics too, definitely going to copy some ideas from <a href=\"https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/\">@stammy's website</a></li>\n<li>Build an <strong>about</strong> page (meh)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The website is not fully responsive yet and there are probably lots of bugs, but oh well. Please <a href=\"https://github.com/edmundojr/edmundojr.github.io/issues/new\">report</a> if you find any bugs. üêõ</p>\n<p>On each and every one of the blogs I've started in the past I posted this quote, so here it is again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúThe scariest moment is always just before you start.
